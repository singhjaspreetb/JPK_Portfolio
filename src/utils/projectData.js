const researchInterest = "My research interest lies in designing and developing systems with required degrees of freedom and constraints. Exactly-constrained design leads to deterministic behaviour and thus helps in achieving higher precision and reliability. On the other hand, overconstrained design requires high tolerances, increased effort in alignment and assembly, and higher stresses. Compliant mechanisms or flexures are key components in achieving higher precision. They can easily replace conventional joints if the range of motion is limited. These mechanisms can be easily integrated in designing not only high end machines but also daily use items and products. They further help in miniaturization and thus they are used in designing sensors and micro-actuators.";
